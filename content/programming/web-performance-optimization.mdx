Web performance is critical for user experience. Let's explore proven optimization techniques.

## Core Metrics

Focus on Core Web Vitals:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## Optimization Strategies

### Code Splitting

Break your code into smaller chunks and load them on demand to reduce initial bundle size.

### Image Optimization

Use modern image formats, responsive images, and lazy loading to minimize image payload.

### Caching

Implement effective caching strategies for static assets and API responses.

## Monitoring

Use tools like Lighthouse and Web Vitals to continuously monitor and improve performance metrics.
