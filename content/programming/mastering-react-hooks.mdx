React Hooks revolutionized the way we write functional components. Let's explore how to master them.

## Understanding Hooks

Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components. Common hooks include:

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer

## Building Custom Hooks

Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions. This promotes code reuse and cleaner components.

## Best Practices

Always follow the Rules of Hooks to ensure your application works correctly. Use linting tools to catch issues early.
