Sustainability isn't just a buzzword—it's a responsibility we all share. Here are practical ways to make a difference.

## Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

The classic approach still works:

1. **Reduce** consumption of new products
2. **Reuse** items before discarding them
3. **Recycle** properly according to local guidelines

## Energy Conservation at Home

### Simple Changes

- Switch to LED bulbs (75% less energy than incandescent)
- Unplug devices when not in use
- Use programmable thermostats
- Improve home insulation

### Estimated Monthly Savings

| Action                      | Monthly Savings |
| --------------------------- | --------------- |
| LED bulbs                   | $5-10           |
| Smart thermostat            | $10-15          |
| Energy-efficient appliances | $15-20          |

## Sustainable Transportation

- Walk or bike for short distances
- Use public transportation
- Carpool when possible
- Consider an electric vehicle

## Food Choices Matter

```
Impact of different diets on carbon footprint:
Meat-heavy diet:     ████████████ 7.8 kg CO2/day
Vegetarian diet:     ████████ 5.2 kg CO2/day
Vegan diet:          ████ 2.9 kg CO2/day
```

## Water Conservation

- Fix leaks promptly (a dripping tap wastes 15,000 liters yearly)
- Install low-flow showerheads
- Collect rainwater for plants
- Run full loads in washers and dishwashers

## Supporting Sustainable Brands

Research companies that:

- Use ethical sourcing
- Minimize packaging waste
- Support fair labor practices
- Invest in renewable energy

Begin with one or two changes this month, then gradually add more. Small actions create big impact when multiplied by millions.
