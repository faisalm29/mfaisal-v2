Public speaking is a skill, not a talent. Anyone can master it with practice and the right approach.

## Understanding Speaking Anxiety

### Common Fears

- Fear of judgment
- Forgetting what to say
- Being awkward or stumbling
- Not being good enough

**Good news**: These are completely normal and manageable.

## Preparation is Key

### Structure Your Talk

1. **Hook** (first 30 seconds) - Grab attention
2. **Opening** - Introduce yourself and topic
3. **Main content** - 3-5 key points
4. **Stories and examples** - Make it memorable
5. **Closing** - Strong finish and call-to-action

### The 70/20/10 Rule

```
70% - Preparation and practice
20% - Natural talent and experience
10% - Luck/timing
```

## Techniques for Confidence

### Breathing Exercises

Before speaking:

- Slow, deep breaths (4-count in, 6-count out)
- Reduces anxiety and steadies voice
- Practice for 2-3 minutes before presenting

### Body Language

| Good             | Avoid                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Eye contact      | Looking at notes only |
| Open posture     | Crossed arms          |
| Natural gestures | Standing rigidly      |
| Movement         | Pacing nervously      |
| Smiling          | Frowning/serious      |

## Content Delivery

### Pacing and Pauses

- Speak at 130-150 words per minute
- Pause after key points (let it sink in)
- Use silence strategically
- Don't rush due to nervousness

### Voice Control

- **Vary tone** - Keeps audience engaged
- **Articulate clearly** - Avoid mumbling
- **Speak from diaphragm** - Stronger, clearer voice
- **Modulate volume** - Emphasize important points

## Visual Aids

### Slide Design Principles

- **One idea per slide**
- **Large, readable fonts**
- **Minimal text** - You're the presentation
- **Strong visuals** - Photos beat bullet points
- **Consistent styling** - Professional appearance

```
Poor: 15 bullet points per slide
Good: 3 key takeaways with imagery
```

## Handling Difficult Situations

### If You Lose Your Place

- Pause and take a breath
- Look at your notes
- Ask the audience a question
- Continue confidently

### Dealing with Interruptions
