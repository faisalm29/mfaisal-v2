Perfect Days is about finding grace in routine, beauty in banality, and healing through quiet existence. It's not for everyone — slow and sparse by design — but if you surrender to its pace, it’s a soul-nourishing experience. A film that watches you back, in silence.

Did you watch it already? Curious how it hit you emotionally — it's one of those that can mean very different things depending on your state of mind.
