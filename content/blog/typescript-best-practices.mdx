TypeScript brings type safety to JavaScript. Here are the best practices for production-ready code.

## Type Safety

Always enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json to catch potential errors early. Use explicit types instead of relying on inference.

## Code Organization

Structure your types and interfaces logically. Keep type definitions close to where they're used or in dedicated type files.

## Error Handling

Use discriminated unions and exhaustive type checking to handle errors safely throughout your application.

## Testing

Write tests alongside your TypeScript code to ensure type safety translates to runtime correctness.
