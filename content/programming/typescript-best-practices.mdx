TypeScript brings type safety to [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). Here are the best practices for production-ready code.

## Type Safety

Always enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json to catch potential errors early. Use explicit types instead of relying on inference.

```typescript title="tokens.ts"
export const tokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: {
      50: "#eff6ff",
      500: "#3b82f6",
      900: "#1e3a8a",
    },
    neutral: {
      0: "#ffffff",
      100: "#f5f5f5",
      900: "#171717",
    },
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: "0.25rem",
    sm: "0.5rem",
    md: "1rem",
    lg: "1.5rem",
    xl: "2rem",
  },
  radii: {
    sm: "0.25rem",
    md: "0.5rem",
    lg: "1rem",
    full: "9999px",
  },
} as const;
```

## Code Organization

Structure your types and interfaces logically. Keep type definitions close to where they're used or in dedicated type files.

## Error Handling

Use discriminated unions and exhaustive type checking to handle errors safely throughout your application.

## Testing

Write tests alongside your TypeScript code to ensure type safety translates to runtime correctness.
