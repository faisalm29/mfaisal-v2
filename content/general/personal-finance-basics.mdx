Financial literacy is a superpower. Here are the fundamentals everyone needs.

## The Money Mindset

Before tactics, understand these principles:

- **Spend less than you earn** - The foundation of all finance
- **Time is money** - Compound interest rewards patience
- **Risk and reward** - Higher returns require higher risk
- **Education pays** - Financial knowledge compounds

## The Budget Foundation

### 50/30/20 Rule

| Category | Percentage | Examples                    |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Needs    | 50%        | Housing, food, utilities    |
| Wants    | 30%        | Entertainment, hobbies      |
| Savings  | 20%        | Investments, emergency fund |

Adjust based on your life stage and income.

## Building an Emergency Fund

**Your safety net:**

1. Start with $1,000 for minor emergencies
2. Build to 3-6 months of expenses
3. Keep it in a separate, accessible account
4. Don't touch it unless truly necessary

## Understanding Debt

### Good vs Bad Debt

**Good debt** (investments in growth):

- Mortgages (building equity)
- Education (increasing earning potential)
- Business loans (generating income)

**Bad debt** (consumer debt):

- Credit card balances with interest
- High-interest personal loans
- Depreciating asset purchases

### Debt Payoff Strategies

**Snowball method**: Pay smallest balances first (psychological wins)
**Avalanche method**: Pay highest interest first (mathematically optimal)

## Investing Basics

### Start Simple

### Time Horizon Matters

| Timeframe  | Strategy              |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| < 5 years  | Cash/bonds (low risk) |

| > 10 years | Stocks (growth)       |
